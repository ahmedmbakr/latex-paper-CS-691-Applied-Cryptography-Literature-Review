Blockchain in the data marketplace ensures the secure and transparent exchange of data while preserving privacy, thereby enabling new business models and opportunities for data monetization.
Additionally, blockchain technology has the potential to transform data management in both medical and IoT applications, with the need for innovative data marketplaces becoming increasingly apparent for safe and efficient data exchange.
Nonetheless, the use of a blockchain-based data marketplace presents several challenges such as scalability, data accuracy, verifying data availability, and navigating legal and compliance issues due to its newness.
This paper reviews blockchain-based medical and IoT research that addresses trading issues and provides a comprehensive comparison between them.
Finally, it is hoped that this article will encourage further research into this developing field by outlining promising directions for the future.
