% Conclusion

In addition, a comprehensive review of privacy preservation and incentive fairness were provided.
Furthermore, several approaches to deal with security, privacy, and fairness challenges were described.
% Future directions
Finally, the future direction in this field can be concluded as follows.
First, anonymity shall be provided to all involved parties while having the possibility of revealing the real identity of a misbehaving party by consortium management.
Second, different \ac{zkp} techniques emerge to prove knowledge of the secrets without revealing them to the verifying parties.
